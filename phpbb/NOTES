== On extensions ==

There is no need to activate an extension upon install, because the installer does this
automatically if the extension files are in the right place prior to install.

However, there is a need to activate extension upon upgrade, because the new
Site JSON might have an additional extension.

== On CLI ==

There are two identically-named CLI scripts: one in bin/ and one in install/
The one in bin/ does not work during install, and vice versa.
